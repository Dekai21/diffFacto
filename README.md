## Introduction
We introduce DiffFacto, a novel probabilistic generative model that learns the distribution of shapes with part-level control. We propose a factorization that models independent part style and part configuration distributions, and present a novel cross diffusion network that enables us to generate coherent and plausible shapes under our proposed factorization. Experiments show that our method is able to generate novel shapes with multiple axes of control. It generates plausible and coherent shape, while enabling various downstream editing applications such as shape interpolation, mixing and transformation editing.
